Aspiring Software Engineer | Java Developer | Problem Solver Focused on Algorithms and Systems  

I am a Computer Science and Systems student at the University of Washington Tacoma, passionate about building software that is logical, efficient, and impactful. I enjoy working on projects that push my understanding of algorithms, system design, and clean, modular code architecture. I bring a strong foundation in Java, recursion based problem solving, and validating complex data structures, paired with a growing interest in automation and systems engineering shaped by my real world work experience at Amazon.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Systems at the University of Washington Tacoma. My academic focus includes:

- Algorithm design and analysis  
- Object oriented programming  
- Software engineering principles  

My short term goal is to apply my technical and analytical skills in a software engineering internship. Long term, I aim to contribute to innovative systems that improve efficiency, reliability, and user experience.

My experience at Amazon’s fulfillment center strengthened my appreciation for automation, workflow optimization, and data driven decision making concepts that closely parallel the logic and structure of computing.

Outside of coursework, I enjoy solving logic puzzles, exploring system design problems, and continuously improving my skills through independent projects.

## Projects (Work in Progress)

Below are three featured academic projects that highlight my growth in algorithms, Java, and problem solving. All projects were developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Clock Shop

**Tags:** Java · Object Oriented Programming · Algorithms · File I/O · 2025  

**Description:**  
A fully validated 24 hour digital clock system with strict time validation for hours, minutes, and seconds. Includes comparison features, time advancement, and layered logic that would fit real world timing systems.

**Technologies Used:** Java, IntelliJ IDEA, File I/O, OOP principles  

**Key Challenges:**

1. Designing consistent validation logic across edge cases such as time rollover.  
2. Maintaining strict encapsulation across multiple interacting classes.  
3. Keeping comparison logic both accurate and efficient.

**Key Learnings:**

- Reinforced OOP principles like encapsulation, cohesion, and decomposition.  
- Practiced modeling real systems through layered, modular logic.

### Recursive Math Library

**Tags:** Java · Recursion · Algorithm Design · 2024  

**Description:**  
A recursion only mathematical utility class that implements a set of operations without any loops, imports, or object instantiation.

**Technologies Used:** Java, recursion, IntelliJ IDEA  

**Key Challenges:**

1. Turning naturally iterative ideas into purely recursive solutions.  
2. Avoiding stack depth issues by designing efficient recursive patterns.  
3. Maintaining clarity, readability, and correctness under strict constraints.

**Key Learnings:**

- Deepened understanding of recursion and divide and conquer patterns.  
- Strengthened ability to design mathematically precise algorithms.

### Skyscraper Puzzle Validator

**Tags:** Java · Algorithms · File I/O · Validation Logic · 2024  

**Description:**  
A Java program that reads, validates, and analyzes Skyscraper puzzle configurations using clue based logic and structured grid parsing.

**Technologies Used:** Java, IntelliJ IDEA, File I/O, validation algorithms  

**Key Challenges:**

1. Mapping external file data to an internal grid model.  
2. Designing clear and modular validation functions such as `isValid` and `countVisible`.  
3. Creating readable debug output and grid displays to trace logic.

**Key Learnings:**

- Improved modular design and testability with decomposed helper functions.  
- Practiced balancing correctness, readability, and maintainability.
