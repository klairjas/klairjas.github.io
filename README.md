## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Systems at the University of Washington Tacoma. My academic interests include:

- Algorithm design and analysis  
- Object oriented programming  
- Software engineering principles and design patterns  

In the short term, I aim to apply my technical and analytical skills in a software engineering internship. Long term, I want to contribute to systems that improve efficiency, reliability, and user experience.

My experience at Amazon’s fulfillment center has strengthened my appreciation for automation, workflow optimization, and data driven decision making. The way large scale systems move, track, and route items closely mirrors the structured logic used in computing, which motivates me to keep learning and building.

Outside of coursework, I enjoy solving logic puzzles, exploring system design ideas, and improving my skills through independent coding projects.

## Projects (Work in Progress)

Below are three featured academic projects that highlight my growth in Java, algorithms, and problem solving. All projects were developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Clock Shop

**Topics:** Java · Object Oriented Programming · Algorithms · File I/O  
**Year:** 2025  

**Description:**  
Engineered a fully validated 24 hour digital clock system with strict time checking for hours, minutes, and seconds. The system supports time comparison, advancement, and layered logic that can model real world timing systems.

**Technologies Used:**  
Java, IntelliJ IDEA, File I/O, object oriented design

**Challenges:**

1. Designing consistent validation logic across edge cases such as time rollover and invalid inputs.
2. Keeping the codebase modular while multiple classes interacted to represent different aspects of time.
3. Ensuring that comparison methods remained accurate and easy to reason about.

**Key Learnings:**

- Reinforced core OOP principles like encapsulation, cohesion, and clear decomposition.  
- Gained practice modeling real world systems using layered, testable logic.  


### Recursive Math Library

**Topics:** Java · Recursion · Algorithm Design  
**Year:** 2024  

**Description:**  
Created a recursion only mathematical utility class that implements a set of operations without using loops, external libraries, or object instantiation. The focus was on logical purity, mathematical correctness, and clarity.

**Technologies Used:**  
Java, recursion, IntelliJ IDEA

**Challenges:**

1. Converting naturally iterative ideas into purely recursive functions.  
2. Managing recursive depth to avoid unnecessary overhead or stack issues.  
3. Keeping functions readable and well documented under strict constraints.

**Key Learnings:**

- Deepened understanding of recursion and divide and conquer strategies.  
- Improved ability to design mathematically precise algorithms with clear base and recursive cases.  


### Skyscraper Puzzle Validator

**Topics:** Java · Algorithms · File I/O · Validation Logic  
**Year:** 2024  

**Description:**  
Developed a Java program that reads and validates Skyscraper puzzle configurations from external files. The program uses clue based logic and grid parsing to determine whether a given puzzle satisfies all constraints.

**Technologies Used:**  
Java, IntelliJ IDEA, File I/O, validation algorithms

**Challenges:**

1. Mapping file based input into a structured internal grid that stayed easy to debug.  
2. Designing modular validation helpers like `isValid` and `countVisible` to keep logic organized.  
3. Producing readable debugging output and formatted grid displays for testing.

**Key Learnings:**

- Strengthened modular design and testability through well decomposed helper functions.  
- Gained experience balancing correctness, readability, and maintainability in a non trivial validation task.
