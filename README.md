# Hello, I'm Jaskaran Klair
Aspiring Software Engineer | Java Developer | Problem Solver Focused on Algorithms & Systems

I am a Computer Science and Systems student at the University of Washington Tacoma, passionate about building software that is logical, efficient, and impactful. I enjoy working on projects that push my understanding of algorithms, system design, and clean, modular code architecture. I bring a strong foundation in Java, recursion-based problem solving, and validating complex data structures—paired with a growing interest in automation and systems engineering shaped by my real-world work experience at Amazon.

# About Me

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Systems at the University of Washington Tacoma. My academic focus includes:

Algorithm design and analysis

Object-oriented programming

Software engineering principles

My short-term goal is to apply my technical and analytical skills in a software engineering internship. Long-term, I aim to contribute to innovative systems that improve efficiency, reliability, and user experience.

In addition to my academic work, my experience at Amazon’s fulfillment center strengthened my appreciation for automation, workflow optimization, and data-driven decision-making—concepts that closely parallel the logic and structure of computing.

Outside of coursework, I enjoy solving logic puzzles, exploring system-design problems, and continuously improving my skills through independent projects.

# Projects (Work in Progress)

Below are three featured academic projects that highlight my growth in algorithms, Java, and problem-solving. All projects were developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Clock Shop

Java • Object-Oriented Programming • Algorithms • File I/O (2025)

Description:
A fully validated 24-hour digital clock system supporting strict time validation for hours, minutes, and seconds. Includes comparison features, time advancement, and layered logic ideal for real-world timing systems.

Technologies Used: Java, IntelliJ, File I/O, OOP principles

Key Challenges:

Designing consistent validation logic across multiple edge cases (e.g., time rollover).

Maintaining strict encapsulation across multiple interacting classes.

Ensuring comparison logic was both accurate and efficient.

Key Learnings:

Reinforced strong OOP principles (encapsulation, cohesion, decomposition).

Gained experience modeling real-world systems through layered, modular logic.

## Recursive Math Library

Java • Recursion • Algorithm Design (2024)

Description:
A recursion-only mathematical utility class implementing a suite of mathematical operations without loops, imports, or object instantiation.

Technologies Used: Java, Recursion, IntelliJ

Key Challenges:

Converting naturally iterative concepts into purely recursive logic.

Avoiding stack overflow by designing efficient recursive structures.

Maintaining clarity, readability, and correctness under strict constraints.

Key Learnings:

Deepened mastery of recursion and divide-and-conquer patterns.

Strengthened ability to design mathematically precise algorithms.

## Skyscraper Puzzle Validator

Java • Algorithms • File I/O • Validation Logic (2024)

Description:
A Java program that reads, validates, and analyzes Skyscraper puzzle configurations using clue-based logic and grid parsing.

Technologies Used: Java, IntelliJ, File I/O, Validation Algorithms

Key Challenges:

Mapping external file data to a structured internal grid model.

Designing clear and modular validation functions (isValid, countVisible, etc.).

Creating informative debugging outputs and readable grid displays.

Key Learnings:

Improved modular design and testability through decomposed helper functions.

Gained experience balancing correctness, readability, and maintainability.
